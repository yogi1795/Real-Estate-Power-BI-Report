## 🏡 Austin Housing Data Insights – A Power BI Dashboard
I’m excited to share my Power BI series: **“Austin Housing Data Insights”**, an in-depth analytics dashboard that explores real estate trends in one of America’s fastest-growing cities—**Austin, Texas**.

This dashboard was built with a focus on interactivity, user experience, and data storytelling. It serves as a strategic tool for **real estate professionals, data enthusiasts**, and anyone interested in **housing market dynamics**.

#### 💡 Enhanced User Experience
